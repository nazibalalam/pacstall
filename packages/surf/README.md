surf is a simple web browser based on WebKit2/GTK+. It is able to display websites and follow links. It supports the XEmbed protocol which makes it possible to embed it in another application. Furthermore, one can point surf to another URI by setting its XProperties.

    I though exactly the same before. I always had +20 tabs open in firefox. Honestly, I'd never thought I'd enjoy using a browser with no tab support until I forced myself to use surf for a week. I am now much less distracted and more focused when browsing the web. dwm + surf <3
